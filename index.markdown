## <a name="intro"></a>Introduction  
This site covers how to create both front and back post double crochet stitches. Front/back double crochet stitches create a thick, textured fabric that can be used for anything from potholders to blankets. In order to create these two stitches, the slip stitch, the double crochet, and some general knowledge are required. This site also attempts to provide the necessary knowledge on these topics.
