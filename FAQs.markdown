## What is the difference between a crochet hook and a knitting needle?
* The biggest difference is that the crochet hook has well, a hook, while the knitting needle smoothly tapes off to a dull point (hence the name: needle).
* Knitting needles also often have a stopper of some kind at the end of them, while crochet hooks do not.

## What is yarn weight?
* Yarn weight is the thickness of a yarn. It is typically measured on a scale from 0 to 6, where 0 is the thinnest yarn.
* A particular yarn's weight is typically listed on the yarn ball's label.

## What is the yarn tail?
* The yarn tail refers to the end of the yarn.

## What does it mean to yarn over?
* To yarn over, pass the hook around your working yarn from the left.

## What does it mean to pull through a certain amount of loops?
* This means that you use your hook to pull the topmost strand of yarn through x number of loops.
  - You always begin with the topmost loop.

## Where do I insert my hook into a chain?
* Every chain ends up being comprised of three distinct strands.
* When you insert your hook into a chain, you want your hook to be below the top two strands and above the bottom strand.

## What does it mean to pull up a loop?
* If you are told to pull up a loop, then you are in a situation where you have already:
  - inserted your hook into a stitch or chain
  - and yarned over.
* In order to pull up the loop,
  - use your hook to pull the yarned over yarn back out of the stitch or chain you had inserted it into.


## What direction do you crochet in?
* If you are chaining, you crochet from left to right.*
* If you are creating regular stitches, you crochet from right to left.*
